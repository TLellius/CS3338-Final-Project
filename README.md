IMPORTANT: This project does not officially represent the Viper Rocks! (now named Lunar Rocks!) project in any capacity. This project is using it as a template as we test our expertise in various tools including: GitHub, Docker, Jira, TestRail, and LaTeX.
However, we do encourage you to look into the Lunar Rocks! project if you have an interest in participating and contributing to the study of lunar geology, as well as lunar exploration!
