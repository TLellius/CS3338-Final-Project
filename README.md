IMPORTANT: This project does not officially represent the Viper Rocks! (now named Lunar Rocks!) project in any capacity. This project is using it as a template as we test our expertise in various tools including: GitHub, Docker, Jira, TestRail, and LaTeX, for CS 3338: Software Engineer Tools, a class in Cal State LA.

We were unable to finish TestRail due to the free trial for TestRail Cloud ending before we finished creating test cases and test runs. We reached out to the professor and they were willing to overlook this problem

The Viper Rocks! project plays a vital role in establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon: a vision that NASA shares. Mapping and analyzing the distribution of materials and resources on the Moon paves the way for further understanding of the Moon and its mysteries.

To better support this initiative, we wish for the project to involve the public. We hope to interest citizen scientists, both amateur and expert, to participate in learning and understanding lunar geology. With the use of our interactive tools to map and classify lunar rocks, we believe this will make lunar exploration an accessible and collaborative effort between the experts and the interested public!

We encourage you to look into the Lunar Rocks! project if you have an interest in participating and contributing to the study of lunar geology, as well as lunar exploration!
