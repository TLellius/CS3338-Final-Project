The Viper Rocks! Website has many processes, working together to give users an easy and intuitive interface to
access the website's many features.



The Viper Rocks! main control system handles web display. Web display means rendering the contents of what the
user should currently be looking at.

The database handles requests from all aspects of the website, mainly the main control, the main page, the main
tasks, and the explore page.

The main control acts as the middleman between the sign in page and the database. When users attempt to login,
the sign in page sends a signal to the main control who sends a signal to the database. If the login credentials 
are correct, the database will send back the data necessary to process the login. If the login credentials are 
incorrect, the database will send back a deny message that states the credentials were incorrect. The user will
have to try to login again.

The sign-in page also lets a user create an account. If the user wishes to do so, they can go to the sign-up page.
When the user gives a username, password, and email for their account, once again the main control acts as a
middleman between the given page and the database. If the username or email matches an account in the database
already, then the database will reject the sign-up request. If there is no match, then the database accepts the
sign-up request and records the account details.

The main page gets the data necessary to render itself and its related pages from the database. When the user
enters the main page, they start off on the Home page. The user may also go to the About Us or the Contact Us
page.

The main tasks page is where users can conduct their lunar rock research and analysis. It leads to the scouting, 
sizing, and classification pages. When the user finishes a task on either of the pages, the user will be taken back
to the main tasks page. Also, the page will mark and record the results of the task to send to the main tasks page.
