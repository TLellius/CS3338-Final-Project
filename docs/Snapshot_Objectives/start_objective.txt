Our start objective covers what we wish to complete in the first 2 out of 4 months of our project:

We have decided on several dependencies for our front-end and back-end. This will form the framework of the
Viper Rocks project.
Front-End:
React: Main UI Framework. Offers many libraries and tools. Its Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) allows for
efficient UI updates and only updates the real DOM, which serves as our UI, only when necessary. It is also
component-based, which means that it is built from small, reusable pieces. This falls under the definition of 
modular. This makes it easier to create, clean, and maintain code.
Vite: Build and Deployment Tool. Allows us to quickly develop web applications in a local dev server. Quickly and 
efficiently bundles our code to be a faster-running website.

Back-End:
Tomcat: Application Server for Backend Hosting. Can run Java-based applications with the support of servlets and 
JSP (JavaServer Pages). It's scalable and easy to configure and deploy with minimal effort necessary.
Node.js: Backend Framework for API Development. It is event-driven, meaning it responds to specified occurrences 
rather than executing the code upon starting up. Offers thousands of npm packages to assist with development. It 
is also scalable. It will also be how we connect to our databases.

We will have one half of our team work on the front-end and the other half work on the back-end. Tasks will be
assigned evenly.
Our current major objective is to get the base features running. We hope for the home page, the login/sign-up page,
the database, and the basic scouting page. The basic scouting page will, for now, access a random layout from
the database. It will split the images into 9 segments in the form of a 3x3 grid.
