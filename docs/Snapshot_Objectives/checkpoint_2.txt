For Checkpoint 2, we wish to finalize our scouting page with the classification section of it. Its purpose is to
streamline the rock classification process with defined categories, clear guidance, and robust ambiguity management.

There are 6 defined shape categories, including: Angular, sub-angular, sub-rounded, and rounded. These all come
with examples for visual guidance. This ensures consistent and accurate classification standards.

We handle ambiguity by skipping unclassifiable cases. We hope to encourage user discussion regarding these outliers

We also plan on creating the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page. It will provide quick answers for common
questions that users tend to have. Not only does this enhance the general understanding of a typical user, it also
reduces the amount of support requests we'd receive that require our attention.
The FAQ page will see constant updates as users continue to use our website.
