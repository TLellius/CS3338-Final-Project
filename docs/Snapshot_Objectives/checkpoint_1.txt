With the basic scouting page established, we now aim to add interactive tools for the user to utilize. These tools
will assist users in efficient rock analysis and progress management. These tools include:
Drag - Rock Selection Tool
Makes selecting and moving rocks using a drag-and-drop tool.
Simplifies the interaction and organization of elements.

Drawing - Precision Tools
Drawing tools that allow for detailed annotations or measurements.
Helps maintain accurate rock analysis and documentation.

Undo/Redo - User Error Recovery
Quickly undo or redo actions to correct mistakes.
Provides an intuitive user experience and promotes user creativity to attempt more unusual decisions.

Save - Progress Preservation:
Automatically saves work periodically to ensure no progress is lost.
Enables users to seamlessly resume tasks from where they left off.

We also hope to establish a Contact Us Page, which will provide users a way to reach out to us, the creators,
in regards to inquiries, support, or feedback. This ensures that the thoughts of the user are directed to the
appropriate channels for efficient resolution. It will also build trust and good will between us and the users
that wishes to foster the organization and the community surrounding lunar geology.
The Contact Us Page will consist of a Name, Email, and Message text section for the user to type into to explain
their query while also providing a way to reply back to their questions or feedback.
