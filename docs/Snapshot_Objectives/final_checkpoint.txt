We are satisfied with what our website currently has to offer. Our goal for this final checkpoint is to improve our
UI and optimize the many technical aspects of our website, including:
Front-End: 
Performance Optimization: Faster load times 
Accessibility: Intuitive UI for all user types, especially those who suffer disabilities
Back-End: 
Efficient Data Management: Optimizing storage, indexing, and retrieval of the website's datasets
Integration: Establishing smooth communication between Java servlets and Node.js to keep the data flow across the system reliable
Real-Time Processing: Ensuring low-latency responses to support user interactions like rock scouting and classification

We hoped to add a more robust system for handling ambiguous rocks during the rock classification process, however
we'll have to start on that after the initial launch of the website. Still, we are very proud of the work we have
done and wish to continue working on this project in support of connecting the public to science and lunar geology.
