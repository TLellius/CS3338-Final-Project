Objectives: 
The Viper Rocks! project plays a vital role in establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon: a vision that NASA shares. Mapping and analyzing the distribution of materials and resources on the Moon paves the way for further understanding of the Moon and its mysteries.

To better support this initiative, we wish for the project to involve the public. We hope to interest citizen scientists, both amateur and expert, to participate in learning and understanding lunar geology. With the use of our interactive tools to map and classify lunar rocks, we believe this will make lunar exploration an accessible and collaborative effort between the experts and the interested public!
